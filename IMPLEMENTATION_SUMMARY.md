# Patch Memory Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the patch memory system that automatically applies instruction patches when a memory region is expanded and relocated.

## Components Created/Updated

### 1. Config System (`ff8_hook/include/config/memory_config.hpp`)

**New Configuration Classes:**
- `BaseMemoryConfig`: Base configuration with common fields including optional `patch` field
- `CopyMemoryConfig`: Extends base config for memory copy operations  
- `PatchMemoryConfig`: Extends base config for patch operations

**Key Features:**
- `has_patch()` method to check if patch file is specified
- Validation methods for each config type
- Shared base fields (key, address, copy_after, description, patch)

### 2. Patch Memory Task (`ff8_hook/include/memory/patch_memory.hpp`)

**PatchMemoryTask Class:**
- Loads patch instructions from TOML files (like `magic_patch.toml`)
- Parses instruction bytes with 'XX XX XX XX' placeholders
- Calculates new addresses using memory base + offset
- Applies binary patches to FF8 memory with proper memory protection
- Supports both positive and negative offsets

**Key Features:**
- TOML parsing with regex patterns for sections, bytes, and offsets
- Binary patch application with `VirtualProtect` for memory safety
- Placeholder replacement (0xFF bytes → actual addresses)
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 3. Updated Config Loader (`ff8_hook/include/config/config_loader.hpp`)

**Enhancements:**
- Added support for `patch = "filename.toml"` field in memory configs
- Uses new config namespace structures
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing configs

### 4. Enhanced Hook Factory (`ff8_hook/include/hook/hook_factory.hpp`)

**New Logic:**
- Creates `CopyMemoryTask` for all memory configs (as before)
- Additionally creates `PatchMemoryTask` when `patch` field is present
- Ensures proper task ordering (copy first, then patch)
- Uses updated config namespace types

### 5. Task Error System (`ff8_hook/include/task/hook_task.hpp`)

**New Error Types:**
- `dependency_not_met`: When patch task can't find required memory region
- `patch_failed`: When binary patching operations fail

## Workflow

1. **Configuration Loading**: `ConfigLoader` reads memory configs from TOML
2. **Hook Creation**: `HookFactory` creates hooks at specified addresses
3. **Task Execution Order**:
   - `CopyMemoryTask` executes first: allocates new memory, copies data
   - `PatchMemoryTask` executes second: reads patch file, applies binary patches
4. **Patch Application**: 
   - Load instruction patches from TOML file
   - Get new memory base address from context
   - Calculate final addresses (new_base + offset)
   - Apply binary patches with memory protection

## Example Usage

**Memory Config (`config/memory_config.toml`):**
```toml
[memory.K_MAGIC]
address = "0x01CF4064"
originalSize = 2850
newSize = 4096
copyAfter = "0x0047D343"
patch = "magic_patch.toml"  # ← This triggers patch memory task creation
description = "K_MAGIC data structure - expanded for custom spells"
```

**Patch File (`config/magic_patch.toml`):**
```toml
[instructions.0x0048D774]
bytes = "8D 86 XX XX XX XX"  # ← XX XX XX XX gets replaced with new address
offset = "0x2A"              # ← Offset from new memory base
```

**Runtime Execution:**
1. Memory copied from `0x01CF4064` to new allocated region
2. Instruction at `0x0048D774` patched to point to `new_base + 0x2A`
3. FF8 now uses expanded memory seamlessly

## Benefits

- **Automatic Patching**: No manual binary modification required
- **Dynamic Memory**: Supports arbitrary memory expansion sizes
- **Configuration Driven**: Easy to add new memory regions and patches
- **Safe Patching**: Proper memory protection handling
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Full visibility into patch operations
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of patch failures

## Integration

The system integrates seamlessly with existing FF8 Script Loader architecture:
- Uses existing hook management system
- Leverages existing task framework
- Maintains existing config file format (just adds optional `patch` field)
- Works with existing memory context system

This implementation fulfills the original requirement to "patch original memory access with new memory address" in an automated, configuration-driven way.

## ✅ Build Status

**SUCCESSFULLY BUILT** - All components compile without errors:
- ✅ `ff8_hook.dll` - Main hook library with patch memory system
- ✅ `ff8_injector.exe` - DLL injector
- ✅ All dependencies (MinHook, spdlog) - Built successfully

Minor warning (unused variable) exists but does not affect functionality.

**Build Command:**
```bash
cmake --build build --config Release
```

**Output Files:**
- `build/bin/Release/ff8_hook.dll`
- `build/bin/Release/ff8_injector.exe`
